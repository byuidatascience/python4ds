With plotly, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.\n",

At that point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the geoms within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting). You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.\n",

        "[Plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a Python implementation of [ggplot2 in R's](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) grammar of graphics using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) as the plotting backend. Plotly's implementation of the grammar of graphics is much like ggplot2 or plotnine at a high level.  However, it uses the [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) grammar of graphics constructs and plotting backend. \n",
